    <string name="about_text">WakeUpBuddy is a class project inspired by two Vanderbilt students. It follows from the simple
        fact that college students tend to oversleep after \'working hard\' so one might need to wake another up through a phone
        call at a specific time. But what happens if the person forgets to wake his or her sleeping buddy? This is where 
        WakeUpBuddy was birthed. Simply remotely set an alarm on your buddy\'s phone which will be triggered at a specific time.
        This saves you the trouble of forgetting to wake the person up.      
          Enjoy!! </string>

    <string name="help_text">Welcome to WakeUpBuddy! If you have ever had to wake up a deep sleeper, this app was created for you. To view contacts, click on buddies on the main screen.
        From here, you can navigate to Add Contacts where you can select a user from the list of users in the online wakeupbuddy database. Once you have contacts, click on their name to open the send alarm option. 
		An extra fun part is the addition of a \'message box\' where you can send a message to your buddy. 
		Finally, do not forget to select your customized ringtone for waking up anyone. If the same ringtone does not exist on your buddy\'s phone, their default alarm tone will be used.  
		\nEnjoy this unique app, the first of its kind!!!
		\n Thank you!</string>
